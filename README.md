DESCRIPTION:In this project smart dustbin is built on a microcontroller based platform Arduino Uno board which is interfaced with the Servo motor and ultrasonic sensor . Ultrasonic sensor is placed at the top of the dustbin which will work according to the distance, It then sends the signals to Arduino Uno. The Arduino understands the signal and sends a signal to the Servomotor which opens the flap on top of the dustbin.
